# How to access the API

## First Contact

For your first contact with our API, we recommend to use a GraphQL explorer, such as [Altair GraphQL Client](https://altairgraphql.dev/). Itâ€™s available as a desktop application and we really like it like that.

## Endpoint

The GraphQL API's endpoint is the following: https://api.opencollective.com/graphql/v2

## Authentication

The API is public and you can freely use it up to 10 requests / minute without authentication.

By authenticating, you get up to 100 requests / minute, access to sensitive data and can perform actions.

## With a Personal Token

The Personal Token gives you access to the API and is automatically authenticating you as an individual. To create one, go to your personal settings and navigate to the `For developers` section.

    <p style="text-align:center;margin-bottom: 1em;"><em>Applications section</em></p>

    <p style="text-align:center;margin-bottom: 1em;"><em>Create Personal Token</em></p>
</div>
-->

There are multiple ways to pass the Personal Token:

- In the URL: `https://api.opencollective.com/graphql/v2?personalToken=<PERSONAL_TOKEN>`
- As an HTTP header: `Personal-Token: <PERSONAL_TOKEN>`

## With OAuth

OAuth lets you create applications that can access Open Collective's API to read information and trigger changes on the platform.

Documentation is here for now: https://docs.opencollective.com/help/developers/oauth
