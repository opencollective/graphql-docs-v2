# How to access the API

First you need to get an API Key. The API Key give you access to the API and is automatically authenticating you. To get yours, go to your profile menu and navigate to the `Applications` section.

<div>
    <img src="/access/applications.png" style="margin:auto;display:block;" />
    <p style="text-align:center;margin-bottom: 1em;"><em>Applications section</em></p>
    <img src="/access/api-key.png" style="margin:auto;display:block;" />
    <p style="text-align:center;margin-bottom: 1em;"><em>Generate API Key</em></p>
</div>

## First Contact

For your first contact with our API, we recommend to use a GraphQL explorer, such as [GraphQL Playground](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-playground). Itâ€™s available as a desktop application and we really like it like that (thanks [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/)!)

## Endpoints

The GraphQL API's endpoint is the following: https://api.opencollective.com/graphql/v2

## Authentication

There is multiple way to pass the API Key:

- In the URL: `https://api.opencollective.com/graphql/v2/<API_KEY>`
- As an HTTP header: `Api-Key: <API_KEY>`
