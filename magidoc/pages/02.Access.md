# How to access the API

## First Contact

For your first contact with our API, we recommend to use a GraphQL explorer, such as [Altair GraphQL Client](https://altairgraphql.dev/). Itâ€™s available as a desktop application and we really like it like that.

## Endpoint

The GraphQL API's endpoint is the following: https://api.opencollective.com/graphql/v2

## Authentication

The API is public and you can freely use it up to 10 request / minute without authentication.

By authenticating, you get up to 100 requests / minute, access to sensitive data and can perform actions.

## With an API Key

The API Key give you access to the API and is automatically authenticating you. To get yours, go to your profile menu and navigate to the `Applications` section.

    <p style="text-align:center;margin-bottom: 1em;"><em>Applications section</em></p>
    <img src="/access/api-key.png" style="margin:auto;display:block;" />
    <p style="text-align:center;margin-bottom: 1em;"><em>Generate API Key</em></p>
</div>

There is multiple way to pass the API Key:

- In the URL: `https://api.opencollective.com/graphql/v2/<API_KEY>`
- As an HTTP header: `Api-Key: <API_KEY>`

## With OAuth

OAuth lets you create applications that can access Open Collective's API to read information and trigger changes on the platform.

Documentation is here for now: https://docs.opencollective.com/help/developers/oauth
