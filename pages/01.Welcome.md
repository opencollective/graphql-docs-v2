# Open Collective Public GraphQL

Welcome to [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com)'s public GraphQL API documentation.

This documentation will help you get started using our public GraphQL API (v2).

## Overview

Open Collective's GraphQL API allows developers to interact with the Open Collective platform programmatically. With this API, you can:

- Retrieve detailed information about accounts
- Access financial data including transactions, contributions, and expenses
- Query financial contributors
- Create and manage expenses
- And much more!

## Limitations

The following functionality is not supported yet from external applications:

- **Payment Provider Integration**: Operations related to creating contributions with integrated payment providers (Stripe, PayPal) cannot be performed through the API from external applications. As an alternative, you can explore the [Embed contribution flow](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/collectives/embed-contribution-flow) feature.
- **Captcha-Protected Operations**: Any operations that require captcha verification for security purposes are not accessible via the API.
